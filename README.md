# DforDuck

DforDuck is a toy programming language implemented in C, designed to serve as a practical learning tool for understanding interpreter and compiler development concepts. Inspired by Bob Nystrom's insightful book, ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), this version of DforDuck employs a bytecode virtual machine.

## Overview

DforDuck was developed as a hands-on project to deepen comprehension of interpreter and compiler principles outlined in Bob Nystrom's book. It serves as a practical exploration into the complexities of language design, parsing, and execution.

## Features

- Bytecode virtual machine architecture.
- Implementation of fundamental language constructs.
- Designed for experimentation purpose.

## Key Resources

- [Bob Nystrom](https://stuffwithstuff.com/)'s book, ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/): Provides invaluable guidance on creating programming language interpreters and compilers.
- [DforDuck GitHub Repository](https://github.com/your_username/DforDuck): Access the source code and contribute to the project.

## Getting Started

To test any of the duck scripts follow these steps.

```
$ cd examples
